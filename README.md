## 📚 Citation & Prior Art

This work is published with a DOI via **Zenodo** (10.5281/zenodo.18134920)  
and constitutes **prior art** for code-driven mechanical design methodologies.

---

## 🕰 Historical Context

Prototype fabrication → machining → dimensional measurement → drawing.  
Three-dimensional objects are projected onto two-dimensional drawings  
using orthographic projection, and conversely, three-dimensional form  
is reconstructed mentally from two-dimensional drawings.

This bidirectional translation constituted a **core skill**  
for traditional mechanical designers.

From this perspective, it is understandable that  
**generative design or code-driven approaches**—where the designer  
does not directly manipulate geometry—can feel intuitively  
difficult to accept.

However, semiconductor layout design followed a **similar trajectory**.

There was a time when routing was performed manually,  
with designers carefully accounting for process-specific behavior  
based on experience and tacit knowledge.

As design rules were formalized and incorporated into **PDKs**,  
the center of design activity shifted  
from manual layout to logical description using **Verilog**.

Viewed in the context of technological history,  
it may be unavoidable that mechanical design  
will follow a comparable path.

## 🏆 Why Full Code Mechanical Design Wins

Mechanical design should not be treated as a static artifact  
(CAD data or drawings),  
but as a **reproducible, evolvable set of rules**.

**Full Code Mechanical Design** shifts the core of mechanical design from  
manual GUI operations to **explicit, executable code**.

In this approach:

- 🧮 Geometry is defined by code, not by mouse operations  
- 📐 Dimensions are variables, not fixed values  
- 🧠 Design intent is explicit and reviewable  
- 🧪 Verification and design live in the same environment  
- 🧱 Mechanical design becomes reusable intellectual property (IP)  

This is **not an efficiency improvement**.  
It is a **structural transformation** of mechanical design itself.

Once design logic is expressed as code,  
there is no reason to return to GUI-driven workflows.

---

## 🧠 Concept

Traditional CAD workflows are heavily dependent on GUI operations,  
feature histories, and constraint-based assemblies.

This project intentionally avoids those assumptions and adopts the following principles:

- 🔢 Dimensions are **variables**  
- 🧩 Geometry is defined by **functions**  
- 📦 Parts are treated as **modules**  
- 📐 Assemblies are defined by **placements**, not constraints  
- 👁 The GUI is used only as a **viewer**  

The goal is to preserve **design intent and reproducibility** directly in code.

---

## ❓ Why Code-Driven Mechanical Design?

- ♻️ High reproducibility (identical results on every execution)  
- 🔁 Easy generation of design variants and parametric families  
- 🧠 Design intent is explicit and version-controlled  
- 🤖 Strong compatibility with automation (CSV, optimization, FEM, CAM)  
- 🏗 Suitable for complex systems and equipment-level design  

This approach can be summarized as:

> **Mechanical Design as Code**

## 📐 Design Policy

- ❌ Do not rely on FreeCAD GUI operations  
- ✅ Prefer direct OCCT-based geometry (Part module)  
- ⚠️ Use Sketch / PartDesign only when strictly necessary  
- 📍 Define clear reference origins and orientations for all parts  
- 🧭 Define assemblies using explicit coordinate placements

## ▶ Quick Start (Minimal Reproducible Example)

This repository includes a **minimal working example** that generates  
a simple 3D mechanical model using **FreeCAD in headless (non-GUI) mode**.

### 🔧 Requirements

- FreeCAD 0.21 or later  
- Python bundled with FreeCAD  

⚠️ **Important**  
Do **NOT** use system Python.  
You must use the Python interpreter bundled with FreeCAD.

---

### ▶ Execution (Windows example)

```powershell
cd src
"C:\Program Files\FreeCAD 0.21\bin\FreeCADCmd.exe" build.py
```

This will:

- 🧩 Generate a simple part defined in `parts/`  
- 🧭 Assemble it using placement logic in `assembly/`  
- 📄 Create a FreeCAD document (`.FCStd`) as output  

The FreeCAD GUI is **not required** for model generation.  
It may be used only to inspect the generated result.

---

### ▶ Execution (Linux example)

```bash
cd src
freecadcmd build.py
```

---

### 🎯 Purpose of This Example

This example is intentionally **minimal**.

Its purpose is **not** to demonstrate complex geometry,  
but to prove that:

- Geometry can be generated **entirely by code**  
- Design intent lives in **Python**, not GUI operations  
- CAD is an **execution engine**, not an authoring environment  

---

## 🚧 Status

This repository currently focuses on defining the  
**conceptual and architectural principles**  
of Full Code Mechanical Design.

Python / FreeCAD implementation examples  
will be added incrementally.

---

## 🧭 Philosophy

> CAD is not a drawing tool.  
> It is an engine for executing design logic.

---

## 🧱 Example Output

The following model was generated by running the provided Python code in FreeCAD  
without any GUI-based modeling operations.

## 📐 Geometric Core Example (Function-Defined Geometry)

The following model demonstrates a **purely geometric solid**  
generated from a continuous mathematical function,  
without sketches, constraints, or GUI-based modeling steps.

## 📐 Advanced Geometry Examples (Executable Design Intent)

### 🌀 Twisted Loft Solid — Function-Defined, Code-Only Geometry

This example is generated by the following script:

- `src/geometry/loft_twist.py`

The solid is created by **lofting multiple cross-sections whose orientation is continuously rotated as a function of axial position**.

No Sketch, no constraints, no PartDesign features are used.  
All geometry is defined explicitly in Python and executed by FreeCAD as a geometry engine.

<a href="http://samizo-aitl.github.io/full-code-mechanical-design/fig/03_loft_twist_solid.png" target="_blank">

       alt="Twisted loft solid generated purely by Python code (FreeCAD)"
       style="width:80%;">
</a>

**Key characteristics:**

- Cross-section defined by mathematical functions
- Continuous twist angle:
  
$$\theta(z) = f(z)$$

- Deterministic loft generation via OCCT (`Part` module)
- Fully reproducible from code execution

> This geometry has no feature history.  
> The **only source of truth is the Python code itself**.

---

### 🌿 Branched Spiral Sweep — Branch-Aware Parametric Geometry

This example is generated by:

- `src/geometry/branched_spiral.py`

The model demonstrates a **branched spiral sweep**, where multiple spiral paths diverge from a common origin and are swept with a function-defined cross-section.

Such geometry is extremely difficult to author or modify in conventional GUI-based CAD systems, but becomes a **natural consequence of code-defined logic**.

<a href="http://samizo-aitl.github.io/full-code-mechanical-design/fig/04_branched_spiral_sweep.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="http://samizo-aitl.github.io/full-code-mechanical-design/fig/04_branched_spiral_sweep.png"
       alt="Branched spiral sweep solid generated purely by Python code (FreeCAD)"
       style="width:80%;">
</a>

**Key characteristics:**

- Parametric spiral paths with explicit branching logic
- Sweep profiles defined by functions (no sketches)
- Branching handled in code, not as a CAD exception
- Geometry regenerated identically on every execution

> Once geometry is expressed as code,  
> **branching is not a special case — it is just control flow**.

---

## 🧠 Why These Screenshots Matter

These figures are not mere visual examples.

They serve as:

- ✅ Proof of **non-GUI, non-interactive CAD authoring**
- ✅ Visual evidence of **Executable Design Intent**
- ✅ Direct linkage between **code → geometry → DOI**
- ✅ Prior art disclosure of code-driven mechanical design

The generated CAD files are artifacts.  
The **design itself lives in code**.

---

## 🧩 Design Pattern Summary

| Script | Geometry Type | Core Idea |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| `loft_twist.py` | Twisted loft solid | Continuous function-defined orientation |
| `branched_spiral.py` | Branched sweep solid | Branch-aware parametric path logic |

These scripts demonstrate that **mechanical geometry can be treated as an executable system**, not a manually authored shape.

---

## 🔌 Analogy to SoC Design

This approach is directly analogous to modern **SoC design workflows**.

- Geometry generation → layout  
- OCCT → geometry engine  
- Python → RTL  
- Assemblies → floorplanning  
- CAD → execution environment  

In this sense:

> **Full Code Mechanical Design is to mechanical engineering  
> what RTL is to SoC design.**

---

## 💎 Beyond CAD: Mechanical Design as IP

By expressing geometry, constraints, and design decisions  
entirely in code, mechanical design itself becomes  
a **reusable and evolvable intellectual property (IP)**.

The generated CAD model is only a byproduct.  
The true asset is the **executable design knowledge**.
